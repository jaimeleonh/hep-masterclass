    "**ROOT** (https://root.cern/) is the most common data analysis tool in Particle Physics. It can be used un two languages, C++ and Python. Additionally, several tools have been developed in recent years that allow to work with ROOT files, such as [uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This tool allows to open ROOT files in python and work with the data using more industry-standard tools, such as numpy or pandas. In our case we will work with [awkward arrays](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/index.html), similar to numpy but more HEP-oriented."
